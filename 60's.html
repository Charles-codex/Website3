            <p>The 60's in a lot of ways was similar to the 50's. Cars being produced were stylish as ever. The economy was booming. Everyone was happy with life and where they were.</p>
            <p>During the 60's cars have come a long way from the previous decade. This generation car manufacterers started to take luxury into account and started making cars nice to be in and not so rough around the edges. This generation was also birth to the pony era, also known as the Ford Mustang.</p>
            <p>The Ford Mustang as we know it today was also a big advancement in technology and cars. Ford wanted to make a car that was fun and enjoyable for people to drive. Hence the Mustang. It was an exhilerating car to drive unlike any other. Easy to drive, quick, light, and manuverable. It was meant to be a fun weekend car or just a fun car to drive to work every once in a while.</p>
            <p>The Pontiac GTO was another car that was a huge advancement. During the 60's, they were heavy, and big. However, with its big 400 cubic inch motor, these cars were nothing to make fun of. They could do 0-60 in 5.2 seconds, which back then no other car could do.</p>
