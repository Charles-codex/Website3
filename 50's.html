            <p>The 50's were a great decade for America. This was when everything was booming and America was growing at an exceeding rate. It was an especially great decade for cars. Cars at this point in time were both powerful with their engines but also stylish and good looking. Engineers and people that made the cars wanted them to look stylish for the people to buy them. The 50's were when cars were still beautiful and good to look at. However, it also comes with its setbacks because cars weren't very safe at this point. They looked good, yes, but they weren't very safe because they didn't have any airbags installed. Crumple zones also were not a thing at this point in time so there were a lot more car accident deaths than before.</p>
            <p>Cars made in the 50's, though not commonly seen today, are still popular and well known among car enthusiasts. They love these cars for these looks and how unique they are because how rare they are.</p>
